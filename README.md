## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page! Iâ€™ve uploaded some of my work from my physics degree. Although my current research deviates from my original studies, I still enjoy discussing any topic in physics!

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my PhD, Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcement learning, which I plan to implement in my future research.
- âš¡ Fun facts about me: Iâ€™m a big Star Wars fan, I love exercising (lately Iâ€™ve been into bouldering!), and I keep a coffee-rating chart that I update whenever I try a new coffee spot.
