## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my PhD Iâ€™m currently working on learning reinforcement learning, which I will implement down the line in my research.
- âš¡ Fun facts about myself: I'm a big fan of Star Wars, I love exercising (Recently I'm into bouldering!), and I've a coffee rating chart that I keep track of and update when I try new coffee spots.
